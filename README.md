# NPCCore - The minecraft NPC mod

The aim of this is simple. Create a mod that allows the player to interact with an NPC in the most immersive way possible.
NPCCore allows for full management of your dialogues with the NPCs. From how you start your interaction to every little part you select to talk about (This is also easily modifiable via the json files "common.json" and "npc.json"). In the current state (commit "Works") the mod doesnt contain much more, but there will follow more in the hopefully not to far future.
